       <p>Your foolproof guide to cleaning up your diet, eating healthier and feeling better.
        You've probably heard of clean eating, but you may not know what it is exactly or how to go about cleaning up your diet. It's about eating more of the best and healthiest options in each of the food groups—and eating less of the not-so-healthy ones. That means embracing whole foods like vegetables, fruits and whole grains, plus healthy proteins and fats. It also means cutting back on refined grains, pesticides, additives, preservatives, unhealthy fats and large amounts of sugar and salt. And avoiding highly refined foods with ingredients you'd need a lab technician to help you pronounce. Even if you only take a few steps toward eating cleaner—cutting back on processed foods, for example, or eating more fruits and veggies (and, if it works for you, buying a few organic)—it can still make an impact on your health. Here are some helpful tips to get you started.</p>
